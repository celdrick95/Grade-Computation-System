# Grade-Computation-System
This VB.NET program calculates a student’s average grade based on scores in Math, Science, and English. It displays the student’s name, individual grades, and computed average, then shows if the student passed or failed. If any subject grade is below 75, it also lists which subjects need to be retaken.
